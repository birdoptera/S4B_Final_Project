# Project outline:

The purpose of our project is to create a pipeline in R (potentially with code in other language) that will take publically available collection data for a taxa, map the potential niche of the taxa and map how the potential niche will change as a result of climate change. 

For our project we are: 
1. downloading publically available collection data, 
2. creating raster maps, 
3. downloading publically available environmental data and creating a raster stack, 
4. downloading publically available climate change prediction data and creating a 'future niche' raster stack, 
5. using modeling techniques to analyze the niche data
6. creating maps showing how potential niches will change as a result of climate change

We have the following members in our group:
- Oluwamosope Adeniji
- Gwendolyn Bird
- Gabriela Chavez Calvillo
- Iwo Gross
- Chloe Kaczvinsky

While we do have more group members than recommended, we think that this many members is necessary because of the complex nature of the project including such difficult and diverse topics as constructing niches, modeling, and creating complex graphs. The (putative) distribution of labor is:
- Project leader and creating niches- Gwendolyn
- Writing the README and validating sources - Chloe
- Checking code and figuring out how to download collection data - Iwo
- Data modeling- Sopa
- Creating potential niche maps - Gabby
