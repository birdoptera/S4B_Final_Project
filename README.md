More info about species distribution models, if you want to read up about it: https://rspatial.org/sdm/, https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.110308.120159



Packages needed: 


Step 1: Obtain collection records
    I'm using a package to download collection records from https://www.idigbio.org/, but https://www.gbif.org/ also has collection records. We could modify the code so it downloads both and combines the two data sets

Step 2: Create a raster map from collection records

Step 3: Obtain niche data and identify niches
    How are we creating our niches?
    I'm using worldclim or bioclim, but is there other data I could be using?

Step 4: Create a new map, showing the potential niche of the species in the current climate
    Otherwise we will be comparing a realized niche map to a potential niche map 

Step 4: Find climate change data and figure out how to use it

Step 5: Use climate change projections to create new potential niche map
