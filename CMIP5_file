CMIP5 can be downloaded using spatial (R package) -there is a function getData in spatial that can pull from CMIP5 data

since spatial is a package used by people doing species distribution likely a decent package

Check how the literature has responded to the source. Is it good?
There is a special model we need to specify, which one should we specify as a default

A global perspective on CMIP5 climate model biases. Nature Climate Change 4,
201-205 (2014).

This paper found significant regional biases in sea surface temperature associated with
sometimes geographically distant factors such as a weak Atlantic meridional overturning
circulation creating large-scale cold biases in the norther hemisphere.

However, the presence of biases in the model is unsurprising.

models and comparisons with observations. Biogeosciences 10, 1717-1736 (2013).

Also found significant issues with the ESM model of soil carbon simulations.

Many papers use it and the concensus seems to be that though there are significant issues,
this is roughly where the field is at the moment. Therefore, using CMIP5 in our models
seems relatively well supported, despite the issues with it.
